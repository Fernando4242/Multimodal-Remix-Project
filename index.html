                                    Since ancient times, humans have looked up to the stars and wondered what they were.
                                    It is only right to start on a new mission that will pave the way to colonization of
                                    other worlds and space exploration. Humanity eventually needs to reach other planets
                                    inside and outside the solar system. Our neighbor, Mars, can be that first planet
                                    for humanity. The world should focus on colonizing Mars because it
                                    will establish a new era for humanity, it will fix current and future problems, and
                                    it will unite the world.
                                </p>

                                    Whenever there is a breakthrough in technology it accelerates many industries to
                                    increase what they are capable of. These industries can be anything from
                                    manufacturing, construction, research, or just anything that makes human’s daily
                                    life simpler. That will expand our knowledge of the world and the ways we go about
                                    solving problems. Mars requires new technology, it requires the world to survive in
                                    a new atmosphere and most importantly it paves the way for the future, starting now.
                                    Just like the article <cite>“Our Missions on Mars”</cite> written by Tad Daley says,
                                    <q>A Mars program will also generate innumerable technological spin-offs, just as
                                        Apollo did</q>
                                    and kick off a new era where future generations will design new technology (2).
                                </p>

                                    Mars is a whole new planet that is much different than Earth's small Moon. Mars is
                                    further, rockier and a much more difficult task to reach. Therefore,
                                    it will create new technological advances that will not only help us colonize Mars
                                    but also improve our daily lifestyles. Research and this expansion of knowledge have
                                    already started. Research conducted has come across how algae can help fertilize the
                                    ground on Mars and how a certain metal can conduct huge amounts of heat to melt
                                    really hard ice. This new era that Mars will create is not just scientific but as
                                    well about what we write about. It will for sure be written and remembered
                                    throughout history as a huge accomplishment.

                                    The technology created in this era will not only improve our lifestyles but can save
                                    many problems humanity would have faced without it or is facing right now.
                                    Colonizing Mars opens new land for humans to live in and a place to escape from the
                                    increasing dangers of global warming. Another issue is, overpopulation , an
                                    undesirable condition where
                                    the number of the existing human population exceeds the carrying capacity of Earth.
                                    Many countries are having issues with housing, overcrowded jails, and homelessness.
                                    It will also be an issue later into the future as the population keeps on growing
                                    and further increasing the number of resources needed to sustain everyone. That way
                                    Mars plays a big role in this scenario is that once again it provides a new place
                                    for humans to live. It can be a place where we send certain people in the population
                                    and limiting the resources consumed here on Earth.

                                    Studies have shown there are ways
                                    to fertilize and grow plants inside an artificial environment on Mars. According to
                                    “Habilibility of Mars: How welcoming Are The Surface and Subsurface to Life on the
                                    Red Planet” says, “The numerous discoveries of microbial life in extreme
                                    environments on Earth….this expansion of our knowledge has led to a broader
                                    perception of survival capabilities ...of life” that will help kickstart the
                                    colonization of Mars and help solve the growing issues of overpopulation on Earth
                                    (Sielaff and Smith, pg.1). This new planet will be one of the solutions that we can
                                    take to save humanity if anything happens to Earth.

                                    and dedication to make it happen quickly and swiftly. Just like Apollo and the
                                    International Space Station, Mars is a major news heading and topic to discuss.
                                    Humanity has come a long way, each civilization added a token of accomplishment

                                    focusing on right now. According to “Terraforming Mars Is Not Out Of The Question”
                                    it says, “the possibility to terraform Mars partially still exists” therefore its
                                    hards task but humanity as a whole can do it (Vasileva, Iv., et al., pg.11). The
                                    sooner advances happen towards Mars and its colonization then the sooner we have a
                                    solution to save the world from the future problems being caused by current
                                    problems. For example, such as global warming and overpopulation can be addressed
                                    and solved by going to this new planet. Mars will also boost the technological and
                                    research conducted that will eventually not only help the colonization of the planet
                                    but increase daily functions in our daily life. Most importantly, it will bring the
                                    world together into one common goal, which is to reach the next huge milestone for
                                    humanity. Each of these is an important reason why the world needs to dream big and
                                    dream of reaching this planet.
